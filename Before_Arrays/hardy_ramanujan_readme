Mr. Hardy quipped that he came in a taxi with the number '1729' which seemed a fairly ordinary number. Ramanujan said that it was not. 
1729, the Hardy-Ramanujan Number, is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of two different cubes in two different ways.

It can be expressed as 9^3 + 10^3 = 1729     or      12^3 + 1^3 = 1729

Find all numbers until 10.000 can be expressed this way.
