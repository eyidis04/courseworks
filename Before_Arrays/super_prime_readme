Suppose all prime numbers are indexed starting from the value 1:
1st prime number 2
2nd prime number 3
3rd prime number 5
4th prime number 7
5th prime number 11
6th prime number 13
7th prime number 17

If the index of a prime number (ie the integer indicating which prime number it is) is also prime, this prime number is a super 
prime. For example,in the above table 3 (2 indexed),5 (3 indexed), 11 (5 indexed) and 17 (7 indexed) are super prime numbers.
